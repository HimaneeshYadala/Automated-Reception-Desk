# Automated-Reception-Desk
Our project aims to design an automated reception desk for hospitals. The system has an easy-to-use interface allowing patients to check in and make appointments with doctors based on their needs. It can be integrated with the hospital's software and provide real-time updates on doctor availability for a convenient and satsifying experience.
